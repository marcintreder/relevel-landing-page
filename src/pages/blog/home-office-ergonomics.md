If you, like many people, are stuck at home due to the recent coronavirus pandemic, you might notice that your home office doesn't quite resemble the ergonomic (hopefully) workstation that you use at work. 

Are you starting to complain about the neck, back, or butt pain?

Perhaps, you are working from a couch or dinner table? I have heard of people trying to recreate a standing desk near the bar counter in the kitchen- not always a bad idea. When working from home, you are still going to be spending hours and hours in front of the screen, but now your posture is even more compromised as your temporary workspace might not be ergonomically adjusted to what your body needs.

In this post, I'm going to show you how you can quickly adjust your current workstation to improve your posture and prevent the aches. Whether your home office is moved to your guest bedroom, dining room, couch, or garden, let's make the best out of your current situation!

## What Is an Ergonomic Workstation and Why Is It Important to Set It up at Home?

[Ergonomics](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ergonomics) is the science that focuses on improving the design of everyday objects, such as chairs, or desks to optimize them for our use. The goal of an ergonomic workstation is to keep you comfortable and healthy and, at the same time, increase your productivity.

As much as this work from home situation might seem temporary, it's important to create the most ergonomic environment for your office hours. Whatever postural habits you develop during this time they will be with you in a longer run.

Bad ergonomics affect not only the obvious areas of your body, such as your lower back, neck, or wrists. Adapting a bad posture can compress your internal organs, such as your lungs.

> Slouching will not only cause numerous muscle aches but also affect your ability to breathe correctly!

[According to ACE](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5716/how-posture-affects-breathing/) rounded upper back and forward shoulder posture, that we often adopt when working in front of computers, "compresses the thoracic region and does not allow diaphragm (your breathing muscle) to fully open when breathing." So correct your posture for the sake of keeping your lungs healthy!

Let's not allow your temporary workstation to affect your health and posture!

Keep reading to find out how to set up an ergonomic home office for a pain-free experience.

## How to Set up an Ergonomic Home Office?

How many of you had a home office set up before you were forced to work from home? Probably not so many. Even if you already have a dedicated space to call a home office, it might need some enhancement to help you withstand the long hours you spend there.

Whatever home space, you are temporarily calling an office, there are always ways to improve it.

Iâ€™m going to break it down to 3 different scenarios and show you how can each space be adjusted to make it ergonomic and posture-friendly:

1. Traditional desk and chair workstation
2. Dining room workstation
3. Couch workstation

### First Scenario. Traditional Desk and Chair Workstation.

In this scenario you are lucky and you already have a desk and office chair at home. The problem is your desk, and your chair might not be ergonomically set up. Here is a picture of my **NOT** ergonomic home office:

![Bad posture at desk in the home office](/img/group-74.png "Bad posture at desk in the home office will cause pain and injuries")

Here is another shot of the improved workstation using whatever I have available at home.

![Good posture at desk in the home office](/img/group-73-2-.png "Good posture at desk in the home office will help you get rid of back pain")

#### What to Add to Improve the Ergonomics?

1. **Lumbar Support**

   If unsupported, your lumbar spine (lower back) could be exposed to a lot of tension.

   Do you find yourself tucking your tail and sitting back at your chair, almost falling off the seat? That position puts massive stress on your spinal column and the surrounding muscles.

   When talking about the good seated posture, you need to know that it starts at the base of your spine and goes all the way to the top of the head. In other words, the way we position our pelvises impacts the rest of the spine- lower back, upper back, and neck.

   For less strain, sit on top of your sit bones. Try this simple exercise to find out where these bones are and how to maintain a neutral posture.

  <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: fit-content;">
<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" style="width: 100%; max-width: 640px; height: 100%; min-height: 360px; margin: 0 auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJBXKOxGc4A?autoplay=1&mute=1&controls=0&loop=1&modestbranding=1&fs=0&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&playlist=KJBXKOxGc4A&origin=http://relevelapp.com" frameborder="0">
 </iframe>
</div>

   Lumbar support pillows allow you to keep more contact with the back of the chair, which will help you put your pelvis in a better, more posture-friendly place.</p>

   You can improvise and create home-made support with a blanket or a pillow.

   Alternatively, search for [professional lumbar supports online](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-lumbar-support-pillows-4156985).

2. **Footrest**

   Your feet, ideally, should effortlessly rest on the floor. That position relieves the tension put on your lower back while sitting.

   In the dream scenario, you can adjust the height of the chair and your desk to match the 90-110 degree bend in the knees, and 90-110 degree bend in the elbow. This position is the most optimal for long hours of work and the best one to avoid the aches.

   Let's say your chair and/ or desk have only one fixed position, and your feet don't reach the floor. Instead of climbing them on to the legs of the chair, try to use a footrest to bring the ground closer to you.

   Use a stack of books or boxes to elevate the ground.

   If you want to be more pro, check out [the best-rated footrests](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-footrests-4171276).
3. **Seat Cushions**

   You have the opposite problem to the one described above- you sit too close to the ground, and your knees are higher than your hips. As a result, you are tensing up the muscles in front of the hips, which can cause further problems and discomforts such as lower back pain.

   So to help yourself solve this imbalance, improvise with home props to create elevation. You can use a pillow or a blanket.

   There are professional seat cushions on the market that can support your posture. Check them out [here](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-seat-cushions-4159175).
4. **Laptop or Screen Stand**

   Laptop stands are a vital piece of home office equipment!

   Your screen should be set up to the height where your head will neither need to drop to look down or lift to look up. Both of which are bad for your neck. The ideal set up of the screen is when the top of your monitor is at the forehead height and arm distance away from you.

   ![Correct set up of the monitor](/img/group-71.png "Ideal position of the monitor in the home office")

   Not having your screen adjusted to the proper height and distance puts tremendous stress on the muscles surrounding your head, neck, shoulders, and the upper back. They are getting beat up, simply because your head isn't sitting on top of your spine correctly. The neutral neck position is the key!

   To assure you are moving your head from a correct place and not creating too much tension in the nearby muscles, try this simple test

  <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: fit-content;">
<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" style="width: 100%; max-width: 640px; height: 100%; min-height: 360px; margin: 0 auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Jn7hZ5Nv0o?autoplay=1&mute=1&controls=0&loop=1&modestbranding=1&fs=0&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&playlist=5Jn7hZ5Nv0o&origin=http://relevelapp.com" frameborder="0">
 </iframe>
</div>
  
   This hinging motion will help you understand how to move your head without putting strain on your neck. And how to self correct your posture during the day.

   Check out [my blog post](https://www.relevelapp.com/blog/5-steps-to-a-quick-posture-fix-for-neck-pain-and-headache/) about head positioning and the unpleasant consequences of the wrong posture.

   Again, you can be creative with what you already have at home. Most popular are big stacks of books or boxes.

#### Additional Buys for Your Ergonomic Home Office

1. **External Monitor**

   While writing this article, I had a conversation with my husband, a designer, who cannot imagine working from home without an external monitor. Why? The reasons are comfort and better work experience. External screens, assuming they are set up correctly, help you position your head to avoid tensing the upper body. Some of the external monitors are also designed to minimize eye strain. 

   When working on an external monitor, remember that the same rules apply here: keep it 20-30 inches away from your head  keep it straight in front of you, so you don't have to turn your head to look at the screen

   If you want to treat yourself with an external monitor here is a list of[ highest rated products by Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/g18923089/best-monitors).
2. **External Keyboard**

   If you still prefer to use a smaller laptop screen, it is absolutely fine. Just make sure its top should be positioned at the forehead level.  To ensure you are working in this ergonomic position, but at the same time, you don't keep your typing arms in the air creating tension in the muscles and nerves, you might need to purchase an external keyboard. 

   An external keyboard for your home office will help you achieve the correct arm position, which is with the keyboard slightly below the elbow level, and the elbows bend at 90-100 degrees.

   Check out the [best keyboards according to Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-keyboard-10-best-keyboards-compared-1028011).
3. **Wrist Pads**

      These cushiony, jelly pads can be excellent support for your wrists when typing. Do your hands ever get tingly, numb, or painful when typingâ€”ever heard of carpal tunnel? If our wrists are kept incorrectly, there is a risk of potential nerve damage leading to carpal tunnel syndrome. Read more in [my blog post](https://www.relevelapp.com/blog/whats-causing-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-and-how-to-prevent-it/) to find out more about carpal tunnel syndrome. 

      The wrist pads could be a great ergonomic addition to your home office. However, they need to be kept in the right place! The name can be misleading because what you really want to rest on these pads are NOT your wrists but the palms.  Pressing your wrist into the pads can actually cause more trouble because you could be cutting off the blood flow to your palms and putting pressure on your nerves.  You want to make sure that your wrist is in a neutral position (in line with the forearm), and it is slightly higher than your fingers. \
   \
   Here is [a list for you to choose the best wrist (or palm) support](https://techguided.com/best-keyboard-wrist-rests/).
4. **Good Lighting**

   Ensure that your home office has plenty of good, natural (preferably) light.  If you are going to spend hours looking at the screen, you want to make sure that your surroundings aren't dark so that you are not fixing your gaze at one lit up space, which could lead to eye strain and headaches.

   Ergonomic specialists from the University of British Columbia advice to[ take visual breaks for 20 seconds every 20 minutes](http://www.hr.ubc.ca/wellbeing-benefits/files/Visual-ergonomics-resources.pdf). You can use that time to exercises your eyes. Roll them up and down, look side to side, or gaze at a beautiful plant or any eye-pleasing object that you located on your home desk. Try adjusting your screen brightness between 40â€“65% to avoid eye fatigue.

5. **Ergonomic Chair**

   Buying a chair online can be a journey! I have heard of people purchasing numerous chairs, trying them out and returning, because none of them meet their expectations. How else are you going to assure that the chair matches your needs, especially in the current situation where you cannot leave your home to shop for it?

   What to look for when choosing an ergonomic chair:

   * **Adjustable Height**

     This will allow you to keep the right angles in your body to create less strain. You want your feet flat on the ground and your hips at the knee level or slightly higher.
   * **Lumbar Support**

     You want your spine to be perfectly aligned, taken that you will be sitting in your home office for hours. The chair with lumbar support will help you put your vertebral column in a less strenuous position.
   * **Adjustable Recline**

     According to [Ergonomic Trends](http://ergonomictrends.com/proper-sitting-posture-computer-experts/) the most optimal angle for the back of the chair is at 100â€“110 degrees recline. Look for that function in your chair to reduce spinal pressure.
   * **Armrest**

     The armrest is there to help you adjust the position of your elbows. You want to keep them closer to your torso with an angle that is 90-110 degree, to reduce the tension put on your tendons and nerves. I know how stylish a chair without an armrest can be. I own one myself. However, for those long hours spent in front of your desk, invest in a chair with arm support.
   * **Chair Width**

     Your butt, when seated, should touch the back of the chair. There also should be around 2-3 inch gap from the back of the knee and the edge of the chair. That will ensure better circulation of blood and reduce the pressure that we put on the back of the thighs while seated. 

   Now, that you know what to look for in your chair, check out this list of [best ergonomic chairs for your home office](< https://gearpatrol.com/2020/01/29/best-office-chairs/>).
6. **Ergonomic Desk**

     Your desk is often skipped in the process of setting the home office ergonomics in favor of choosing a perfect chair. However, the surface on which you put your computer, keyboard, and mouse is equally important.

     What to look for when choosing an ergonomic desk:

   * **Adjustable Height**

     You want to be able to move from sitting to standing. We are designed to be moving through the day, and spending time in one position isn't good for your spine and your blood flow. Therefore alternating between sitting and standing is a better solution vs. staying in one position for a full day of work. According to the University of British Columbia "[Positional change is the key](http://www.hr.ubc.ca/wellbeing-benefits/files/Working-From-Home.-Temporary-Set-up.-March-2020.pdf)". Try rotating the portions regularly, e.g., every 2â€“3 hours.

      I found this [smart calculator on Ergonomic Trends](http://ergonomictrends.com/the-best-ergonomic-computer-desks/), which can help you choose the perfect height for your desk.
   * **Additional Keyboard Tray**

     Look for an adjustable keyboard tray in your future desk. Why? Because of the wrist position. Feeling painful or tingly in your fingers and thumb? Better placement of the keyboard will put your wrists in a more optimal, less strenuous position for the nerves. 

     The keyboard should be placed in a position where your elbows are slightly higher than your wrists. Your wrist should be kept in neutral and floating about the surface. In that position, you are not cutting the circulation and putting stress on your carpal tunnel.  According to [ergonomic specialists from the University of British Columbia](http://www.hr.ubc.ca/wellbeing-benefits/files/Working-From-Home.-Temporary-Set-up.-March-2020.pdf) your keyboard and mouse should be set below the elbow level allowing it to be at 90-110 degree bend.
   * **Appropriate Width**

     Extend your arm and touch the screen. This is how far you want to place your monitor for the most optimal working position. It is approximately 20-30 inch distance. Your desk should be wide enough to accommodate your laptop or monitor and the possible keyboard or mouse you are using. 

   Keep these tips in mind when choosing your future desk. Here is [a list of best ergonomic computer desks according to Ergonomic Spot](https://ergonomicspot.com/ergonomic-computer-desks/).

### Second Scenario. Dining Room Workstation.

In this scenario, you don't have a separate room to treat as a temporary office space. This happens to the majority of the people I work with! In this case, you need to create the most ergonomic environment on your dining table or such.

The dining tables and chairs might need special enhancing to make them more posture-friendly. Look into the first scenario to see how you can adjust your workstation with props you can find around the house.

Here is an example of **a wrong** dining room set up.

![Wrong set up of a home office in the kitchen](/img/group-69-1-.png "Wrong set up of a home office in the kitchen can lead to significant injuries")

And an improved set up keeping in mind the adjustments mentioned above.

![Correct position while working on a kitchen table](/img/group-72.png "Save your body with a correct posture while working from home!")

#### Items to Add to Improve Your Dining Room Workstation

1. Lumbar support
2. Footrest
3. Seat cushions
4. Laptop stand
5. Good lighting

> For improved productivity, ensure that your workstation is clean and clutter-less.

No dirty leftover dishes from breakfast, no stacks of mail lying around, or any other items that will distract you and reduce your working space.

### 3rd Scenario. Couch Workstation.

If your office moved to a couch, the first few hours could feel pretty comfy. It is later on that some aches might kick in, and you start wondering what did you do wrong.

It is okay to lie down occasionally. Changing body positions throughout the day helps to reduce the strain you put on the muscles and tendons when stuck in one place. However, remember that sitting in a supported neutral position can be a better alternative to lying down.

This is me when I am not trying to keep ergonomics in mind while working from the couch.

![Bad position while working from your coach](/img/group-76.png "Working from your coach can be detrimental to your health")

This is improved couch-potato me.

![Correct position while working from your coach at home](/img/group-75.png "Correct position on your coach while working from home can save your back")

#### Tips for Making Your Couch More Ergonomic

1. **Lumbar Support**

   Just like in previous scenarios, here on a couch, a lumbar support pad can be your best friend. The pillow placed at the level of your lower back helps you to keep the neutral curves of your spine as well as minimizes the strain put on the intervertebral discs.
2. **Recline on the Couch**

   By all means, it is okay to be reclined. The 90-degree angle at your hips and sitting upright for hours at a time can lead to chronic back pain, as suggested by [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/news/20061129/back-pain-eased-by-sitting-back).

    Reclining your chair or, for that matter, your position on the sofa to 110-135 degrees was found to be best in relieving the stress put against the spine.
3. **Tilt the Screen**

    Here on the couch, laptop stands make less sense compared to working from a desk or dining table. Tilting your laptop screen to meet the eye level and ensure a 40-45 degree angle will decrease the strain put on the eyes and neck.

   To look at the screen, try tilting the head rather than dropping it and hanging at the last cervical vertebrae, which puts massive stress on the musculature of your neck and upper back.

## Make Sure Your Workstation Works for You!

I hope you find these tips useful and you can imply them to your temporary home offices and maybe even back to your regular workplaces. 

Remember, you should always listen to your body, and if the set up doesn't work for you, adjust it! With your newly set up ergonomic home office, don't forget to keep moving throughout the day.

* Take breaks for quick 15 minute exercises.
* Take breaks to walk around your house, walk your dog, breathe in the fresh air to exercise your lungs.

> No matter how ergonomic your office space is, if you are not mindful of your posture, you are still going to be in pain!

### Postural Tips for Your Home Office

* Sit on top of your sit bones
* Keep your back neutral
* Keep your head on top of your spine 
* Keep your shoulders back and relaxed
* Don't cross the legs- which reduces the correct blood flow.
