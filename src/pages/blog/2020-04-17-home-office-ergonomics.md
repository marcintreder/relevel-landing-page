If you, like many people, are stuck at home due to the recent coronavirus pandemic, you might notice that your home office doesn't quite resemble the ergonomic (hopefully) workstation that you use at work. 

Are you starting to complain about the neck, back, or butt pain?

Perhaps, you are working from a couch or dinner table? I have heard of people trying to recreate a standing desk near the bar counter in the kitchen- not always a bad idea. When working from home, you are still going to be spending hours and hours in front of the screen, but now your posture is even more compromised as your temporary workspace might not be ergonomically adjusted to what your body needs.

In this post, I'm going to show you how you can quickly adjust your current workstation to improve your posture and prevent the aches. Whether your home office is moved to your guest bedroom, dining room, couch, or garden, let's make the best out of your current situation!

## What is an ergonomic workstation and why is it important to set it up at home?

[Ergonomics](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ergonomics) is the science that focuses on improving the design of everyday objects, such as chairs, or desks to optimize them for our use. The goal of an ergonomic workstation is to keep you comfortable and healthy and, at the same time, increase your productivity.

As much as this work from home situation might seem temporary, it's important to create the most ergonomic environment for your office hours. Whatever postural habits you develop during this time they will be with you in a longer run.

Bad ergonomics affect not only the obvious areas of your body, such as your lower back, neck, or wrists. Adapting a bad posture can compress your internal organs, such as your lungs.

> Slouching will not only cause numerous muscle aches but also affect your ability to breathe correctly!

[According to ACE](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5716/how-posture-affects-breathing/) rounded upper back and forward shoulder posture, that we often adopt when working in front of computers, "compresses the thoracic region and does not allow diaphragm (your breathing muscle) to fully open when breathing." So correct your posture for the sake of keeping your lungs healthy!

Let's not allow your temporary workstation to affect your health and posture!

Keep reading to find out how to set up an ergonomic home office for a pain-free experience.

## How to set up an ergonomic home office.

How many of you had a home office set up before you were forced to work from home? Probably not so many. Even if you already have a dedicated space to call a home office, it might need some enhancement to help you withstand the long hours you spend there.

Whatever home space, you are temporarily calling an office, there are always ways to improve it.

Iâ€™m going to break it down to 3 different scenarios and show you how can each space be adjusted to make it ergonomic and posture-friendly:

1. Traditional desk and chair workstation
2. Dining room workstation
3. Couch workstation

### 1st scenario- Traditional desk and chair workstation

In this scenario you are lucky and you already have a desk and office chair at home. The problem is your desk, and your chair might not be ergonomically set up. Here is a picture of my **NOT** ergonomic home office:

Here is another shot of the improved workstation using whatever I have available at home.

![Good posture at desk in the home office](/img/good-home-office-workstation.jpg "Good posture at desk in the home office will help you get rid of back pain")

#### **What to add to improve the ergonomics?**

1. Lumbar support
2. Footrest
3. Seat cushions
4. Laptop or screen stand

##### 1. Lumbar support

If unsupported, your lumbar spine (lower back) could be exposed to a lot of tension.

Do you find yourself tucking your tail and sitting back at your chair, almost falling off the seat? That position puts massive stress on your spinal column and the surrounding muscles.

When talking about the good seated posture, you need to know that it starts at the base of your spine and goes all the way to the top of the head. In other words, the way we position our pelvises impacts the rest of the spine- lower back, upper back, and neck.

For less strain, sit on top of your sit bones. Try this simple exercise to find out where these bones are and how to maintain a neutral posture.

Lumbar support pillows allow you to keep more contact with the back of the chair, which will help you put your pelvis in a better, more posture-friendly place.

You can improvise and create home-made support with a blanket or a pillow.

Alternatively, search for [professional lumbar supports online](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-lumbar-support-pillows-4156985).

#### 2. Footrest

Your feet, ideally, should effortlessly rest on the floor. That position relieves the tension put on your lower back while sitting.

In the dream scenario, you can adjust the height of the chair and your desk to match the 90-110 degree bend in the knees, and 90-110 degree bend in the elbow. This position is the most optimal for long hours of work and the best one to avoid the aches.

Let's say your chair and/ or desk have only one fixed position, and your feet don't reach the floor. Instead of climbing them on to the legs of the chair, try to use a footrest to bring the ground closer to you.

Use a stack of books or boxes to elevate the ground.

#### 3. Seat cushions

You have the opposite problem to the one described above- you sit too close to the ground, and your knees are higher than your hips. As a result, you are tensing up the muscles in front of the hips, which can cause further problems and discomforts such as lower back pain.

So to help yourself solve this imbalance, improvise with home props to create elevation. You can use a pillow or a blanket.

There are professional seat cushions on the market that can support your posture. Check them out [here](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-seat-cushions-4159175).

#### 4. Laptop or screen stand

Laptop stands are a vital piece of home office equipment!

Your screen should be set up to the height where your head will neither need to drop to look down or lift to look up. Both of which are bad for your neck. The ideal set up of the screen is when the top of your monitor is at the forehead height and arm distance away from you.

![Correct set up of the monitor](/img/monitor-correct-distance.jpg "Ideal position of the monitor in the home office")

Not having your screen adjusted to the proper height and distance puts tremendous stress on the muscles surrounding your head, neck, shoulders, and the upper back. They are getting beat up, simply because your head isn't sitting on top of your spine correctly. The neutral neck position is the key!

To assure you are moving your head from a correct place and not creating too much tension in the nearby muscles, try this simple test

This hinging motion will help you understand how to move your head without putting strain on your neck. And how to self correct your posture during the day.

Again, you can be creative with what you already have at home. Most popular are big stacks of books or boxes.
