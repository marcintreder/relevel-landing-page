If you, like many office workers, are stuck at home due to the recent coronavirus pandemic, you might notice that your home office doesn't quite resemble the ergonomic (hopefully) work station that you are used to at work.

Are you starting to complain about the neck, back or butt ache?

Perhaps, you are working from a couch or dinner table? I have heard of people trying to recreate a standing desk near the bar counter in the kitchen.

When working from home, you are still going to be spending hours and hours in front of the screen, but now your posture is even more compromised as your temporary workspace might not be ergonomically adjusted to what your body needs. 

Seating or standing at your computer, adapting a lousy posture will affect not only your back and neck health but also your ability to breathe correctly! According to [ACE]([https://www.acefitness.org/​education-and-resources/​lifestyle/blog/5716/how-​posture-affects-breathing/](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5716/how-posture-affects-breathing/)) rounded upper back and forward shoulder posture, that we often adopt when working in front of a desk, "compresses the thoracic region and does not allow diaphragm (your breathing muscle) to fully open when breathing." So correct your posture for the sake of your lungs healthy!\

Whether your home office is moved to your guest bedroom, dining room, coach, or garden, let's make the best out of your current situation!\
\
Here are a few tips on how you can quickly and easily adjust your home office space to make it more ergonomic:

## 1st scenario:

You re lucky and you already have a desk and office chair at home. The problem is your desk, and your chair might not be ergonomically set up.

*Here is a little picture of my NOT ergonomic home office.*
