          to miss out on movement. If you don't have a luxury of a 1-hour
          lunchtime yoga class, you can still improve your health and mood by
          practicing personalized workouts in the vicinity of your desk.

        description: >
          The most common ache associated with desk jobs is lower back pain.
          About 80% of adults struggle with lower back pain within their life. 


          The lower back pain you experience can be anything from a mild, dull
          sensation that you can go around with every day to a sharp disabling
          pain that can require special doctor treatments. 

          Implementing a daily workout routine proves to be helpful in relieving
          lower back pain caused by the sedentary lifestyle.

        description: >
          Another common complaint from office workers is shoulder pain. 

          Your shoulders suffer from not being mobilized enough and held in a
          wrong position throughout the day.

          Hunching over your computer, driving with tensed upper back, slouching
          doing your daily chores, etc. All these cause many imbalances in your
          upper back and arms and affect your wellbeing. Relevel training
          program can help you improve your posture and provide a relief to your
          tired shoulders.

        description: >
          With over 8 million people being affected every year, carpal tunnel is
          another common ergonomic disorder.  

          Tingling, numbing, and later on pain in your hand, preventing you from
          holding objects are the consequences of neglecting this condition.

          Repetitive stress, such as typing, moving the mouse, writing, or
          drawing, significantly contribute to this problem. The right set of
          daily exercises can help you alleviate carpal tunnel pain!

        description: >-
          20% to 70% of adults complain about neck pain that disturbs their
          workflow. Leaning towards the screens and taking our head out of its
          optimal alignment causes the muscles of your neck and upper back to
          strain and become painful. Extra stress caused by the increased weight
          on the spine can lead to unpleasant tension headaches. With the right
          daily exercise routine you can eliminate this discomfort!

        description: >
          Sciatica is a condition that affects about 40% of people, many of
          which sit for most of the day. The name comes from the sciatic nerve
          that gets compressed or damaged, causing pain in the lower back that,
          with time, can travels down your leg along the path of the nerve.
          Sciatica can be a very disruptive condition that can interfere with
          the quality of your life!


          Implementing a daily workout routine with Relevel can help you battle
          sciatica!
