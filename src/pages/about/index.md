    title: Our Mission
    description1: Many of us spend the majority of every day sitting. Our jobs require us to spend long hours at our desks or in conference rooms. Unfortunately, the human body is not well adapted to this new reality. Sooner rather than later, we’re starting to feel the consequences of the sedentary lifestyle. We feel the pain. Our backs, necks, shoulders... and other parts of the body are affected, and our productive lives are quickly turning into an unproductive nightmare. This is exactly why we’ve started Relevel. 
    description2: Relevel will give you your life back. Our training programs are custom built to counter the damage caused by desk jobs. We’re on the mission to eliminate pain caused by the sedentary lifestyle.

  description: At Relevel, we believe that a daily dose of movement is essential. No 1-hour of intense workout once a week can substitute an everyday exercise. Even a 15-minute workout a day will improve your quality of life and help to take the aches away. We want to help you be your most productive and happy self at your workplace!
