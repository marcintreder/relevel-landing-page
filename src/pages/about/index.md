Unfortunately, human body is not well adapted to this new reality. Sooner rather than later we’re starting to feel the consequences of the sedentary lifestyle. We feel the pain. Our backs, necks, shoulders... and other parts of the body are affected and our productive lives are quickly turning into an unproductive nightmare.
